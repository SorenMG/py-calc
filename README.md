# Shell calculator
Have your own CAS-tool in your terminal!

# Installation
Install `parser, sympy and fuckit` with pip and run
```
python3 main.py
```

# Usage
The calculator has a wolfram-like approach where you simply type your equation
in the shell and it spits out all possible answers. eg.
```
3x^2
```
